Avoid landing page redirects. This plugin checks which redirections are active and if it finds a double redirection it tries to fix it. Only 4kb in size. 

== Description ==

When optimizing a website, Googleï¿½ Page Speed Insights or GTMetrix.com can display a poor ranking if there are too many redirects for a URL to the landing page. 

If a visitor enters http://domainname.com in the browser, the visitor is redirected to httpS://domainname.com and finally lands on httpS://www.domainname.com. This double redirection is punished by numerous search engines.

This plugin examines the redirects and then issues a suggestion for a solution. By simply clicking on it, the plugin makes the necessary settings in the .htaccess file - including backup of the existing file.

The plugin itself is only 4kb in size. 



== Installation ==



1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
